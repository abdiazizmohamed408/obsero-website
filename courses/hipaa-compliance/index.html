                                <p>Patients can request copies of their medical records. Healthcare providers must respond within 30 days (60 days for records not on-site).</p>

                                <p>Patients can request corrections to their records if they believe information is incorrect or incomplete.</p>

                                <h4>Right to an Accounting of Disclosures</h4>
                                <p>Patients can request a list of when and to whom their PHI was disclosed (with some exceptions for TPO disclosures).</p>

                                <h4>Right to Request Restrictions</h4>
                                <p>Patients can request limits on how their PHI is used or disclosed (though covered entities aren't always required to agree).</p>

                                <h4>Right to Confidential Communications</h4>
                                <p>Patients can request to receive communications by alternative means (e.g., sending mail to a work address instead of home).</p>

                                <h4>Right to a Notice of Privacy Practices</h4>
                                <p>Patients must receive notice of how their information may be used and their rights.</p>

                                <h4>1. Unauthorized Access</h4>
                                <p>"Snooping" in records of family, friends, celebrities, or coworkers without a work-related reason.</p>

                                <h4>2. Lost/Stolen Devices</h4>
                                <p>Unencrypted laptops, phones, or USB drives containing PHI that are lost or stolen.</p>

                                <h4>3. Social Media Disclosures</h4>
                                <p>Posting about patients on social media, even without using names (contexts can identify patients).</p>

                                <h4>4. Improper Disposal</h4>
                                <p>Throwing paper records in regular trash or donating computers without proper data wiping.</p>

                                <h4>5. Unauthorized Disclosures</h4>
                                <p>Sharing PHI with family members without authorization, or discussing patients in public areas.</p>

                                <h4>6. Lack of Safeguards</h4>
                                <p>Failing to implement required security measures—no encryption, no audit logs, no access controls.</p>

                                <h4>7. Failure to Provide Access</h4>
                                <p>Not responding to patient requests for their records within required timeframes.</p>

                                <p><strong>1. Know what PHI is</strong><br>
                                Any information that identifies a patient and relates to their health or healthcare—in any form (paper, electronic, verbal).</p>

                                <p><strong>2. Minimum necessary standard</strong><br>
                                Only access, use, or share the minimum PHI needed for your job function.</p>

                                <p><strong>3. Patients have rights</strong><br>
                                Rights to access, amend, and receive an accounting of disclosures of their information.</p>

                                <p><strong>4. Security is everyone's job</strong><br>
                                Use strong passwords, lock workstations, encrypt devices, and follow security policies.</p>

                                <p><strong>5. Report incidents immediately</strong><br>
                                Don't wait, don't investigate yourself—report any potential breach or violation right away.</p>

                                <p><strong>6. Violations have serious consequences</strong><br>
                                Fines, criminal penalties, job loss, and reputational damage can result from HIPAA violations.</p>
